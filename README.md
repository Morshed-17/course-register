## How did I maintained states of different components in this assignment?

**Answer:** Often my react components needs to remember some information of their own and display it. This kind of task can be done by using a react hook called (useState). For example, in this react Project I have displyed multiple card component. Each component store and update data by in the states that have been created by (useState) hook.
